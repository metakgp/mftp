## Purpose

The files in the folder contain detailed post-mortem of the bugs, issues, or any other problems that may have lead us to downtimes in the past.

## Guidelines

For easy navigation and usage, following key formatting guidelines need to be followed.

1. The name of the file should be in the format `yyyy-mm-dd-summary`.
2. Use the provided template `yyyy-mm-dd-template.md` to base the report on, add more sections and information as necessary.
3. Keep the summary present in the filename concise with 7-8 words at max separated by `-`.
4. When viewing the files, you may want to sort the list in chronological order by using `ls -t`.
